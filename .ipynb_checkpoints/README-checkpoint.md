Data Sets

1. The first data set used is one that shows the all of the different crimes in the city of Pittsburgh in different neighborhoods. (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data)
2. The second data set shows the traffic in each of the neigborhoods. (link)
3. The third data set shows public housing available in each neighborhood. (link)

Conclusion:

The metrics that were used are TC for total crime, total amount of total daily car traffic, and HT or Housing total. These combine into a metric we call black cats. TC accounted for all the crimes committed since 2016 to present day, the traffic metric counted the average traffic daily, and finally HT accounts for the number of available public housing. We decided to name the metric black cats or BC for bad luck. The less black cats the better the neighborhood is. The neighborhood with the lowest BC score is Lincoln Lemington Belmar which was achieved by multiplying those previous values together to get the lowest score. So according to this data Lincoln Lemington Belmar is the best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh. We also found that in our metric almost nothing was even close to Lincoln Lemington Belmar the closest being Lincoln Place which was 20,000 away. There was also South Side Flats which was another 20,000 away from Lincoln Lemington Belmar.
